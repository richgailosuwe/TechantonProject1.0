### What I learned
Building this was very stressful and frustrating for a beginner. At the same time, it was challenging. I had to refer back to my notes, videos and various websites. I learnt a lot doing this on my own. 

# 1] 
I got confused here as to how to make the annual plan price below it without any space. On the group community, few persons had similar issues and I looked at the corrections given and some persons code and I understood it......here's the code snippet below;

```html
 <div class="plan">
              <p><strong>Annual Plan</strong><br><span class="grey">$59.99/year</span></p>
             </div>
```
```css
.plan{
    float:left;
    margin-right:110px;
    
    margin-bottom:50%
}
span.grey{
    color: grey;
}
```



### Continued development
I can't really boast about my flex boxes, so I'll put more effort into that. Infact, everything. I'll continue putting what I've learnt so far into practice. I look forward to being a better programmer

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This gave me a basic or foremost knowledge of how to apply the box shadow.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp)- I'd recommend this site to anyone because this was where I understood css box-shadow property and applied it to my task.
- [Resource 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37831155/how-to-center-three-divs-horizontally-within-a-parent-div) - People asked similar questions on this site and I used the solutions given to them to learn how to center divs horizontally in a parent div.
-[Resource 4](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css)-The link to this article was sent by my mentor to the community group. This article explained extensively yet in simply terms how to center divs in css styling.
